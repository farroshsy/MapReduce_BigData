WordCount is a typical application of the MapReduce algorithm in context of information retrieval. In this tutorial we show the python implementation within this paradigm. As input we use input.txt with some plain text in it.

Pyton supports MapReduce paradigm (and more elaborate functional programming) by the following functions: map (function,list) applies the given function over the collection filter(function, collection) filters using the given function reduce (function, collection) applies reduce successively over the list (slightly different from MapReduce reduce) This makes a pure python wordcount mapreduce very easy
